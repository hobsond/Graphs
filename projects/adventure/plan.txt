create a dictionary for the maps out the rooms
initialized that dictionary with the starting value and empty nsew
create a q
init q with the start
create a var for steps = 0

while there is still an unexplored room and qsize > 0
    deque the q
    You will check the exits of that room

    check the len of the exits
    create a random variable in range of the len of exits
    if that room is not in your map of rooms 
 connect rooms
and add that room to your queue
        step into the next room
            steps +=1

return your steps
